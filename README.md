# CSX64-stdlib
CSX64 is a self-contained, emulated x64 processor *(custom machine code - instruction set based on Intel)* with a built-in assembly language *(Intel syntax - based on NASM)*.

CSX64-stdlib is the common submodule used by all CSX64 implementations. Notably, it contains the specification manual and the standard library files for the linker.

CSX64 is available in [C++](https://github.com/dragazo/CSX64-cpp) and [C#](https://github.com/dragazo/CSX64).
